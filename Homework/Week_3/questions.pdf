Explain the difference between the == operator and the === operator.
    == 
    Means 'equal to', but can also set equal to value of another type, due to the
    fact that, if it is not equal, it tries to convert it to the others type first.

    ===
    When you do not want any type conversions to happen, you have another operator,
    namely === . It  tests whether a value is precisely equal to the other. Useful
    if you do not want unexpected type conversion
